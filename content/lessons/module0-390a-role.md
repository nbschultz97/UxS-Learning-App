### Overview of the 390A Robotics Technician MOS

The **390A Robotics Technician** is a newly established Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) designed to support **Special Operations Robotics Detachments (SORD)**. This role represents a critical evolution in special operations capabilities, integrating advanced robotics, autonomous systems, and edge computing into tactical operations.

As a **Robotics Technical Integrator**, the 390A serves as the **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** for:

- **Planning** autonomous and robotic solutions for mission success
- **Engineering** custom systems tailored to operational requirements
- **Fabricating** field-expedient platforms using additive manufacturing and modular components

This role requires a unique blend of technical expertise, operational awareness, and adaptive problem-solving under austere conditions.

### Core Responsibilities

#### 1. **Mission Planning Integration**
- Collaborate with operational planners to identify robotic mission sets
- Assess terrain, electromagnetic environment, and threat profiles
- Design launch/recovery sites (LRS) and communication architectures
- Integrate UxS capabilities into Troop Leading Procedures (TLP)

#### 2. **Systems Engineering & Customization**
- Configure flight controllers, autopilots, and sensor payloads
- Optimize platform performance for degraded environments
- Troubleshoot hardware failures in the field
- Implement failsafe logic and redundancy systems

#### 3. **Fabrication & Sustainment**
- Operate 3D printers and CAD software for rapid prototyping
- Manufacture airframe components, brackets, and adapters
- Repair damaged platforms using field-expedient materials
- Maintain inventory of critical spare parts and consumables

#### 4. **Cross-Domain Expertise**
- Understand RF spectrum management and JRFL protocols
- Implement counter-UAS (C-UAS) defensive measures
- Integrate platforms with ATAK/TAK networks
- Train team members on safe operation and crew coordination

### Baseline Qualifications & Prerequisites

To qualify for the 390A MOS, candidates must meet strict technical aptitude standards:

#### **ASVAB Score Requirements**
- **Electronics (EL):** Minimum score of **110**
- **Skilled Technical (ST):** Minimum score of **110**

These high thresholds ensure candidates possess the foundational math, electrical, and mechanical reasoning skills required for advanced robotics work.

#### **Recommended Background**
While not mandatory, the following backgrounds are highly valued:
- Prior experience with RC aircraft or FPV drones
- Programming knowledge (Python, C++, or similar)
- Electronics repair or electrical engineering exposure
- CAD/CAM or additive manufacturing experience
- Amateur radio (HAM) license or RF communications knowledge

### Role Tracks Within the 390A MOS

The 390A MOS supports multiple **role tracks**, allowing specialization based on mission requirements and individual aptitude:

1. **UAS ISR Operator Track** – Focus on intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance missions
2. **FPV/ODB Operator-Builder Track** – Emphasis on one-way attack and custom fabrication
3. **RF Mapping/Passive Sensing Track** – Spectrum analysis and electronic warfare support
4. **C-UAS Specialist Track** – Counter-drone defense and threat mitigation
5. **Robotics/Edge-Compute Integrator Track** – Advanced autonomy and AI integration
6. **Additive/CAD Sustainment Track** – Manufacturing and logistics support

Each track requires additional training and certification, but all 390A personnel share a common baseline of technical competency.

### The Integrator Mindset

Success as a 390A Robotics Technician requires more than technical skill—it demands an **integrator mindset**:

- **Adaptive Problem-Solving:** No two missions are identical. You must engineer solutions on the fly.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Work seamlessly with operators, planners, and intelligence personnel.
- **Risk Management:** Balance innovation with safety and operational security.
- **Continuous Learning:** Stay current with evolving technologies, threats, and tactics.

The 390A is not just a technician—you are a **force multiplier**, enabling capabilities that would otherwise be impossible.

### Career Progression

As a 390A, your career path might include:

- **Level 0:** Orientation & baseline technical training
- **Level 1:** Safe operator certification
- **Level 2:** Mission crew integration
- **Level 3:** Role specialist (track-specific expertise)
- **Level 4:** Team lead or integrator
- **Level 5:** Standardization contributor or Center of Excellence (COE) instructor

Continued professional development includes attendance at specialized courses, participation in joint exercises, and contribution to doctrine development.
