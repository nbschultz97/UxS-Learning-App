title: C-UAS Awareness and Reporting
slug: cuas-awareness
module: 7
role_tracks: ['C-UAS specialist track']
level: 2
difficulty: intermediate
estimated_minutes: 13
prerequisites: ['rf-basics']
objectives:
  - Recognize indicators of UAS threats using visual and RF cues (concept level).
  - Describe the detect → cue → report process for small teams.
  - Prepare defensive habits that reduce signature and improve survivability.
key_terms: ['detect-cue-report', 'signature reduction', 'deconfliction']
checklists:
  - Assign observer and recorder roles during training evolutions.
  - Practice low-signature habits: minimize emissions, control lighting, manage movement.
  - Report sightings with location, altitude estimate, track, and confidence.
failure_modes:
  - No dedicated observer leading to late detections.
  - Poor reporting that lacks location/time context.
  - Over-reacting with uncoordinated actions.

### Field Checklist
- Establish observation sectors and timing for scanning.
- Capture sightings in TAK with marker, timestamp, confidence, and direction of travel.
- Communicate calmly using agreed call words; avoid transmitting sensitive details in the open.

### Failure Modes & What to check first
- **Conflicting calls:** rehearse phrasing and sequence before the scenario.
- **Missed cues:** rotate observers to reduce fatigue and tunnel vision.
- **Signature issues:** limit unnecessary emissions and use terrain for masking when appropriate.

### Knowledge Check
1. What information should be included in a C-UAS report?
2. Why is a detect → cue → report flow safer than ad-hoc reactions?
3. How can teams reduce signature during training events?
4. What roles should be assigned during a C-UAS drill?
5. Why is calm, concise communication critical under threat indicators?
