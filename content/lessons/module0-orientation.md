checklists:
  - Review safety pillars: airworthiness, RF discipline, geofence, deconfliction.
  - Confirm local authority, weather, and NOTAM checks for training areas.
  - Identify emergency contacts and reporting paths.

### Field Checklist
- Confirm training area permissions and weather limits.
- Assign mission lead, pilot/driver, payload/sensor, TAK/Comms, maintainer/integrator, and security/recovery roles.
- Review lost-link and emergency landing plan.

### Failure Modes & What to check first
- **No clear lead:** appoint mission lead and confirm comms plan.
- **Airspace conflicts:** check NOTAMs and local restrictions.
- **Gear gaps:** inventory power, spares, and data logging kits before stepping off.

### Knowledge Check
1. What are the three most critical safety pillars before any sortie?
2. Name two responsibilities of the maintainer/integrator during training.
3. Which gating level focuses on role-specific skills?
4. Why is a lost-link plan required during orientation events?
5. How do crew roles reduce task overlap in small teams?
