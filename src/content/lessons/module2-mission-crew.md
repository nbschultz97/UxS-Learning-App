### Field Checklist
- Execute mission brief with time hacks and weather updates.
- Confirm TAK/ATAK data channels and who owns reporting.
- Review lost-link, crash recovery, and battery incident playbook.

### Failure Modes & What to check first
- **Call confusion:** rehearse launch/abort calls before live evolution.
- **No recovery owner:** assign security/recovery role with tools and PPE.
- **Poor notes:** designate a scribe to capture link stats and crew issues.

### Knowledge Check
1. What elements belong in a concise launch call?
2. How should teams assign ownership for TAK/ATAK reporting?
3. Why is a recovery rally point important even for training flights?
4. What should be captured in after-action notes about link performance?
5. How do standardized calls reduce risk under pressure?
